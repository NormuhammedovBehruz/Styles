                        Workplace culture doesn’t start with beanbags, foosball tables, or a beer fridge, and it
                        doesn’t
                        end with neckties, PCs, or big corporations. It’s the unwritten rules, behavior, beliefs,
                        and
                        the motivations that enable good work to get done, or it’s what stifles a workforce. For
                        design
                        to be most effective and for designers to feel valued, we need to work in a culture that
                        embraces design and allows it to succeed.

                        In Aaron’s session he will explore how to recognize the traits of organizations that *get*
                        design, both large and small. He will share what those teams, departments, and companies
                        have
                        that others don’t, and more importantly, how to begin to change your own workplace’s
                        culture.
                        Once you’ve worked within a culture of design it’s almost impossible to imagine yourself
                        anywhere else.

                        Films succeed in evoking responses and engaging audiences only with a combination of
                        well-written narrative and effective storytelling technique. It’s the filmmaker’s job to put
                        this together. To do so they’ve developed processes, tools and techniques that allow them to
                        focus attention, emphasize information, foreshadow and produce the many elements that together
                        comprise a well-told story.

                        cinematic patterns, beat sheets, and storyboards. We’ll consider why they’re used and how we
                        might look to them for inspiration.
